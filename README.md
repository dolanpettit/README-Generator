## Installation Instructions

You can install the program by cloning it to your local machine by running git clone. Once you have succesfully cloned to your local machine, you can remove the existing README.md and run the index.js file in your VSCode terminal. Installation of node dependency 'Inquirer' is required.

## Usage Information

After the program has been installed, run it using node index. You will be prompted with a series of relevant questions about the content of your markdown file. After the final prompt is answered, the program will write a new file called README.md.
